Code for the Baking Converter app.

Categories:
Most Practical/Scalable, Best Original

Instructions: 
This app is Android only. To run, download all the files and put them into the latest version of Android Studio.
Once the files have all been imported, attach an Android device or Android emulator, and run the files.
The app itself is easy to use. Specify the ingredient, how much in the "Enter amount" box, and the units currently being used. Converting to
Metric or Imperial depends on the setting "Conversion Options...". Choosing a different Conversion Option will result in a different conversion. 
Once everything is satisfactory, press the "Convert" button and the results will show up.

Greeting: 
Hello, judges! This is a small, simple, and functional app. Hopefully this prototype accurately captures the idea of what the completed app will be: 
easy conversions between Imperial and Metric units.
